## Experience
### __Research Assitant__  (2022.2 - present)
Advisor: Nicola Bezzo
1. Topic: Path planning for real-time 3D reconstruction for urban environment, using visual cues from plane detection and sparse point cloud.

### __Bytedance Inc.__ (2020.8 - 2021.8)
1. Deep learning multiview stereo and epipolar geometry (MVSNet, VisMVSNet), try out new view selection strategy specifically in panorama image to make the depth map more accurate thus make the fused point cloud denser
2. Cpp implementation of magsac and degensac to avoid dominant plane in essential matrix estimation
3. Git submodule management and online docker environment deployment of the whole 3D reconstruction pipeline

### __Vizen(Beijing)__ (2018.8 - 2019.12)
1. Real-time data transfer IOS app and backend for StructureSensor in BundleFusion(cpp, ffmpeg, ringbuffer) to support online surface reconstruction
2. Cuda implementation of shape from shading in voxel hashing to recover shape detail in the reconstructed mesh from BundleFusion
